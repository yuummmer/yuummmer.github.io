This is my personal website and blog, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Moonwalk theme](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my work in bioinformatics.

## Features
- Blog with posts on bioinformatics and related topics
- Project showcase section

- Custom styling and layouts
- Comments via Utterances
