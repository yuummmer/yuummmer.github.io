# About Me

I create glass art using pâte de verre and kiln casting techniques, giving form to my daydreams. My work is shaped by fleeting thoughts—imaginative visions of what could be, intertwined with lived experience. It’s not about nostalgia, but about exploring the fluid space between memory and possibility. Some childhood experiences shaped me, some I chose to change, and others remain as distant echoes. Through delicate layers and solid cast forms, I capture that tension between fragility and permanence—between the things we remember and the futures we imagine.

This way of thinking extends into my work in bioinformatics. I’m drawn to systems—molecular, emotional, structural—and to the patterns hidden within them. Whether I’m layering powdered glass into a mold or analyzing gene expression data, I find myself entering the same intuitive flow: shaping complexity into form, revealing the invisible. Both art and code allow me to explore what’s beneath the surface—to make sense of shifting structures and translate internal processes into something tangible.

I’m currently studying bioinformatics through UC San Diego Extension, developing projects that combine scientific inquiry, storytelling, and data analysis. In both my artistic and scientific work, I’m interested in the in-between spaces—the places where thought becomes form, where memory meets transformation, and where meaning is shaped by choice.
