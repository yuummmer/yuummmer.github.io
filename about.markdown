ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jennifer Slotnick!

Iâ€™m here to document my journey in bioinformatics, data science, and beyond. My background is a mix of sociology, bioinformatics, and product management, but my passion has always been data-driven researchâ€”especially in biology and healthcare.

I first got into bioinformatics back in high school during an internship at the Molecular Sciences Institute, and later worked in a genetics lab at the Salk Institute during college. After some time in the tech industry as a Product Manager, Iâ€™m now diving back into bioinformatics, refining my coding skills, and exploring the intersection of data science, genomics, and regulatory science.
