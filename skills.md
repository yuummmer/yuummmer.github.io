# Skills & Learning Resources

This is a living list of tools Iâ€™m learning and using in my bioinformatics work â€” along with links to some of the most helpful resources Iâ€™ve found. Iâ€™ve included what each tool is for and how I use it in practice.

Whether youâ€™re just starting out or brushing up, I hope this helps you on your own learning path.

{% assign skill_categories = site.data.skills | group_by: "category" %}

{% for group in skill_categories %}
## {{ group.name }}

{% for skill in group.items %}
### {{ skill.name }}

{{ skill.desc }}

ðŸ”— [{{ skill.link_text }}]({{ skill.link_url }})

{% endfor %}
