# Bioinformatics

I’m currently studying bioinformatics through UC San Diego Extension, building tools and projects that combine scientific curiosity, data analysis, and creative problem-solving. I’m especially interested in how language models, public datasets, and visualizations can make biological insights more accessible and meaningful.
